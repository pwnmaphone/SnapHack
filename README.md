# HD52
HD52 or History Deletor 52 is a vaildation vulnerbility that allows policies set by admins to be overriden by bypassing vaildation
The eexploit works by clicking X when you look something up in your history in the search bar. This for some reason bypasses the policies set by the admin. 
Unknown if the vulnerbility still exists.
