# SnapHack
SnapHack is an app that allows you disable screenshots, story viewing and more. This works by injecting the code into Snapchats memory. A kernel exploit is required to escape the sandbox and allow the injection to happen. Using the code_load app this is achiveved. If you restart your iPhone you will need to rerun both the code_load app and the SnapHack app to regain the extra features. This build only contains the SnapHack and not the code_load app. Also once you press Inject in SnapHack you can close both code_load and SnapHack. Works with with iOS 15-15.0.1.
